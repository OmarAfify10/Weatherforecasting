Weather forecasting utilizing LSTM models, coupled with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), focuses on predicting future weather conditions accurately. LSTM networks excel in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them ideal for modeling complex weather patterns. EDA plays a critical role in understanding dataset characteristics, identifying trends, and optimizing data preprocessing steps. Together, these techniques enable the development of robust weather prediction models, enhancing our ability to anticipate and prepare for various meteorological phenomena
